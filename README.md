# Befor you start
You need to install python

### How to run the file
By default this code will sort your downloads folder in exe ,music ,pdf ,photos ,torrent ,zip.
The code will create directories according to files sorted on the D drive.
If you wish to change the sorting directory change the "path" variable on line 6

### Warnings
IF YOUR MACHINE DOES NOT HAVE A D DRIVE THE CODE WONT WORK.
To change the sorting directory change the "path" variable on line 6 of 'os.py'.


### Changes
if you want to add more sorting file types. You can reffer to the code of os.py as there are steps written how to add them.


### Future changes
* To sort the files you need to manually run the code I am planning to make it a backgroung process.
